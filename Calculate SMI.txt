Calculate the M - midpoint price of the highest high and the lowest low in the selected  range

M = (HighMAX + LowMIN) /2

where

HighMAX = the highest high in the range
LowMIN = the lowest low in the range
Calculate the D - the difference of bar's closing price from the midpoint of the range:

D = Close - M
Calculate Ds - double Exponential Moving Average (MA) applied to D values calculated in the previous step

Ds = MA(MA(D))
Calculate Dhl - double Exponential Moving Average  applied to the difference between highest high and lowest low in the selected period:

Dhl = MA(MA((HighMAX - LowMIN)))
calculate SMI as ratio between Ds and Dhl

SMI = 100 * (Ds / Dhl)
The same as with Stochastics Oscillator, additional Signal Line is calculated as MA applied to the SMI.
